Creating a nail technicians starter business website in an attempt to ease her ability with making and accepting appointments with calendar implementation, the ability for clients to select service add-ons with automatic calculations of services and API integration for connecting to payment service. Clients will have the ability to make an account, if they choose to but also have the ability to continue as a guest.

Technician will have an admin account for ability to block calendar days if needed and an ability to reach out to clients through website will also be implemented.
